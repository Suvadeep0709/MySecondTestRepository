A String is an unavoidable type of variable while writing any application program. 
String references are used to store various attributes like username, password, etc. 
In Java, String objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.
Once String object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new String object is created

Why String objects are immutable in Java?
As Java uses the concept of String literal. Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all refer to one object "Sachin".
If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected by all the reference variables.
 That is why String objects are immutable in Java
