What is String Pool in Java?

String Pool is a storage area in Java heap.
String allocation, like all object allocation, proves to be a costly affair in both the cases of time and memory.
The JVM performs some steps while initializing string literals to increase performance and decrease memory overhead.
To decrease the number of String objects created in the JVM, the String class keeps a pool of strings.
Each time a string literal is created, the JVM checks the string literal pool first.
If the string already exists in the string pool, a reference to the pooled instance returns. 
If the string does not exist in the pool, a new String object initializes and is placed in the pool.
